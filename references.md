# This file is a reference list for parts of my code

For the files listed, I used the getting.started-app code from practical 2:

- /persistence/sqlite.js,
- /persistence/index.js and
- the files in the routes folder,

I used the jwtexpress app from parctical 4 as inspiration for
-/public/js/jwt.js

For the file listed, I took inspiration from a Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M_yaWEqM5E

- /public/css/home.css

In the file listed, I got some help from github copilot to make the correct functions for get, post, delete

- app.js

Copilot helped with some of the css files as well

I used chatGPT to:

- debug the code in /public/js/database.js when i had an error with the delete function
- I also gave chatGPT the app.delete function from the app.js file to figure out if there was something wrong in that file that made the /public/js/database.js error
