This file is a reference list for parts of my code

- for the files /persistence/sqlite.js, /persistence/index.js and the files in the routes folder, I used the getting.started-app code from practical 2

- for the file /public/css/home.css I took inspiration from a Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M_yaWEqM5E 

- in the file app.js I got help from github copilot to make the correct functions

- copilot helped with the login.css
